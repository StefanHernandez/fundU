# fundU
fundU was created using HTML during the 2015 NSBE Hackathon at Lehman College

The challenge we were presented with was to find a way to connect funders with potential 'fundees'. Our team decided why not take as many forms of funds that we could think of an pull it all together on one site.

HTML was learned during the 24 hour event, and our team managed to put together this website with a single concept in mind: 'Keep it Simple'

This front end will be a basis for us to continue our work on in the future.
