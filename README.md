# fundU
fundU was created using HTML during the 2015 NSBE Hackathon at Lehman College

HTML was learned during the 24 hour event, and our team managed to put together this website with a single concept in mind: 'Keep it Simple'

This front end will be a basis for us to continue our work on in the future.
